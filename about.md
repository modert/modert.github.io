# About Me

I'm a nerd.

## Summary

I am a self-taught coder who works through problems generally by trial and error. When I run into a problem, I google and google until I find another piece to the puzzle and continue to work through it until I have a full solution. I have zero formal training, don't really know how to appropriately manage source code and tend to think about things a bit differently. I do my best to think about any security implications, but I'm also not a Security Engineer, so I may leave a gaping hole in my code unknowingly. My solutions and examples are to be used at your own risk.

## The full story

I've always been an Excel geek, so initially I pushed the limits of what Excel could do without VBA (VBA comes later). While building a solar plant, I built a wicked Tracking Workbook that was essentially a color-coded map based on a table of completion dates from an input tab, which at the time was a big feat. I first started learning to code on a RaspberryPi while working Field Service for a Solar Inverter Company. I would sometimes sit at home for an entire week waiting for a call, so I decided to learn something new. With the RaspberryPi and Python, playing with a breadboard and leds, then proceeded mocking up ideas such as a Garage Door Opener App and a Lawn Sprinkler Controller.

My world changed rapidly when I took a position as a Project Cost Estimator for a Construction Company. This is where the fun really began and the VBA mentioned early comes into play. Initially I couldn't believe the manual processes or the lack of advanced formulas within Excel.  I quickly found opportunity to standardize workbooks, create templates, and color code / lock down cells to prevent inadvertent clearing of formulas. Later this evolved into writing VBA with buttons to speed up repetitive tasks as well as ensure calculations worked as expected. After building a Weather Calculator with a self-written JSON Parser (because I didn't know better) for estimating standard weather impact within an expected Project Estimate, I was given a new job.  The new job came with essentially a made up title related to Process Improvement.  My next project was to build out a Unit Billing Web App for a specific segment of our business, which I completed using C#/ASP.NET/JS/HTML/CSS.

The next couple of years have exposed me to even more excitement, I've developed a PowerBI Safety dashboard, worked fulltime on a Conversion/Upgrade of JD Edwards World to EnterpriseOne Project (2 years), built out a SharePoint Template and Provisioning Engine/App for all of our Projects, and working to automate everything I can with PowerAutomate and JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Orchestrator (and the AIS server). I absolutely love that I am constantly learning, generally by solving real world problems and pecking away at it until I can finally get it resolved. I've wanted to start a Blog to share some of the things I have learned for a long time, but as with many of my projects, I just don't have enough time to complete it.  My goal is to get this site established and then regularly add content as I overcome new obstacles that I may not have found an obvious solution to easily online.
