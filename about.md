What can I say, I'm a nerd!

## Summary

I am a self-taught coder who works through problems generally by trial and error. When I run into a problem, I google and google until I find another piece to the puzzle and continue to work through it until I have a full solution. I have zero formal training, don't really know how to appropriately manage source code and tend to think about things a bit differently. I do my best to think about any security implications, but I'm also not a Seucrity Engineer, so I may leave a gaping hole in my code unknowingly. My solutions and examples are to be used at your own risk.

## The full story

I've always been an Excel geek, so initially I pushed the limits of what Excel could do without VBA (VBA comes later). While building a solar plant, I built a wicked Tracking Workbook that was essentially a color-coded map based on a table of completion dates on an input tab, which at the time was a big feat. I first started learning to code on a RaspberryPi while working Field Service for a Solar Inverter Company. I would sometimes sit at home for an entire week waiting for a call, so I decided to learn something new. With the RaspberryPi, I started with Python playing with a breadboard and I/O mocking up ideas such as a Garage Door Opener App and a Lawn Sprinkler Controller.

My world changed rapidly when I took a position as a Project Cost Estimator for a construction company. This is where the fun really began and the VBA mentioned early comes into play. Initially I couldn't believe the manual processes or the lack of advanced formulas within Excel.
